Each specimen serves as a snapshot in a particular place and time in which specific conditions cannot be replicated.

The Collection was started in 1947 by G.E. Bohart, and has expanded rapidly through general collecting efforts, pollination studies, and faunal surveys. It has worldwide coverage with particular strengths in western U.S., Mexico, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Iran, South Africa, and Australia. It houses a number of systematic faunal studies conducted in the western United States: Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, Dugway Proving Ground, San Rafael Desert, Zion National Park, Pinnacles National Monument, and Yosemite National Park.\n\nThe collection is now largely digitized; over 800,000 specimen records are captured in the associated relational database. Specimens have been given unique digitally readable codes and most localities have been georeferenced.  More than 310,000 of the records are now available on the through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). An associated reprint collection of over 17,000 provides access to primary literature on bees and wasps.","cataloguedSpecimens":1200000,"taxonCoverage":"Bees, wasps","contact":"Terry L.

The completion of a Revised Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Bandelier National Monument (Jacobs 2012) represents the first significant update to the flora of the monument in the 20 years since completion of the initial Flora of Bandelier project (Jacobs, 1989). Over 50 additional taxa are documented for the monument, bringing the total from around 746 species in 1989 to 800+ in 2012. The relatively high diversity of vascular plants (800+ taxa documented for 33,000 acre area) reflects the complex topography and wide range of climatic settings available across a nearly 5000-foot elevation range from the Rio Grande at 5300-feet to the summit of Cerro Grande at 10100-feet. However over 15% of the flora is non-native reflecting the legacy of historic landuse and modern disturbances. The monuments herbarium serves the dual purpose of documenting the monuments flora, while also providing a key botanical reference in support of research and monitoring efforts.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"","lat":35.765100,"lon":-106.322100,"institution_code":"NPS","collection_code":"BAND","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:182b40fc-9199-4652-b340-72e79ca7b147","collection_url":"https://www-lib.uwyo.edu/digitalherbaria/"},{"institutionKey":"b4f01445-0fd2-4d04-97c1-3c7ba800d8b7","collectionKey":"03a64ffd-34d0-432c-a152-0d41d41c028f","institution":"Denver Botanic Gardens","collection":"Herbarium","recordsets":"5835f642-2560-4e3e-9c25-741a12cc3fe8","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"5835f642-2560-4e3e-9c25-741a12cc3fe8\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":76500,"taxonCoverage":"Including cultivated plants","contact":"Jennifer Ackerfield","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=124388","lat":39.729900,"lon":-104.960000,"institution_code":"KHD, DBG","collection_code":"KHD","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:f06c8109-e7df-49f8-917f-a8a549dca5b0","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:15415","collection_url":"https://www.botanicgardens.org/our-collections/kathryn-kalmbach-herbarium-vascular-plants","geographic_range":"Colorado","contact_role":"Head Curator","contact_email":"jennifer.ackerfield@botanicgardens.org","mailing_address":"909 York Street","mailing_city":"Denver","mailing_state":"Colorado","mailing_zip":"80206-3799","physical_city":"Denver","physical_state":"Colorado","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:e6c11c15-8861-47bb-8f5a-5fed3a49a07c"},{"institutionKey":"0763a052-c207-44c1-b718-07ecb476ecfa","collectionKey":"fb715388-9d3d-4f14-8520-1081a8f906a3","institution":"California State Polytechnic University","collection":"Herbarium","cataloguedSpecimens":2500,"contact":"Edward Bobich","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=124162","lat":34.058666,"lon":-117.786484,"institution_code":"CSPU","collection_code":"CSPU","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:0b345a85-490c-4d02-818f-44850aca3828","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:13075","collection_url":"http://www.csupomona.edu/~biology/docs/biocoll.html","contact_role":"Director and Curator","contact_email":"egbobich@cpp.edu","mailing_city":"Pomona","mailing_state":"California","mailing_zip":"91768-4032","physical_address":"3801 West Temple Avenue.","physical_city":"Pomona","physical_state":"California"},{"institutionKey":"322c61b5-27e6-4c4e-b066-1246ac2f1ca4","collectionKey":"24da650a-83d2-4b8c-aa5e-33f891451042","institution":"Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History","collection":"Ornithology","recordsets":"3fedbb40-3988-4665-bf86-6b1c89c57215","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"3fedbb40-3988-4665-bf86-6b1c89c57215\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Janet K.

The holdings include at least 18 primary types and 150 paratypes, and dates of collection span from 1878 to the present. The dung beetle collection is the largest in the United States, and our scarab holdings are particularly strong in African as well as regional material. The Colorado Scarab Survey and the Colorado Microlepidoptera Survey, both long-term projects initiated and conducted by DMNS, are steadily growing our regional holdings and our knowledge of the Colorado fauna. The collection is housed in the Avenir Collections Center - an onsite state-of-the-art museum collections facility.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Frank T.

It is an amalgamation of private donations, collections originally in other institutions, and material collected by the Museum. The Curator is assisted in collection chores by 1.5 part-time Collection Associates and about seven Curatorial Assistants (volunteers). BMSM consists mostly of Recent mollusks, with a focus on the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, and the Caribbean. There are circa 2,500 fluid-preserved lots. Fossils represent only 5.5% of the total number of lots. Digitization of the collection started in 1997, through a MS Access-based platform. By the time of the Museum&rsquo;s first accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) (March 2010), only 27,000 lots (out of an originally estimated 120,000) had been catalogued. On that occasion, one of the &ldquo;Areas of Improvement by Next Review&rdquo; recommended by AAM&rsquo;s Accreditation Commission was that the Museum should take action to &ldquo;... further improve the documentation of collections.&rdquo; This process started in October 2012 with the inception of the first of two &ldquo;Museums for America &ndash; Collections Stewardship&rdquo; grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The catalogue resides in a dedicated server, and is backed-up daily both in-house and through a commercial service (Mozy Pro).  In 2011, BMSM incorporated about 11,000 lots from the local Florida Gulf Coast University. The decision by the FGCU administration to move the collection to the Shell Museum shows the degree of trust placed in the organization. The 10,000-lots Redfern Collection, donated in 2014, includes material illustrated in Colin Redfern&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bahamian Seashells&rdquo; books. The regional relevance of the collection is substantiated by circa 7,500 lots of marine mollusks from Sanibel and Captiva islands and neighboring areas. BMSM includes 18 primary types and 211 secondary types. Collection workers are assisted by a 4,000+ volume specialized library, high-resolution photographic equipment with digital stacking software, and other relevant tools and equipment.  Metadata are available from the Shell Museum web site at http://shellmuseum.emc2webs.com/collection/ (right) and iDigBio/Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, left) at http://ipt.idigbio.org/resource?r=bmnsm-shell. About 9,200 lots are georeferenced . The resource has been registered with GBIF, and is itself registered in GBIF as a data publisher endorsed by U.S. Geological Survey. The online identification guide &ldquo;SW Shells with Emphasis on Sanibel &amp; Captiva&rdquo;, currently covering 355 species, is based on the BMSM Collection.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"JosÃ© H.

Tuomey in the mid 1800s and were used extensively for teaching purposes.  Most of the collection was presumably lost during the Civil War when federal troops destroyed the University of Alabama campus.  Only a few of Tuomey's original cabinet specimens survive in the collections of the Alabama Museum of Natural History and the Geological Survey of Alabama. In the 1870s, as professor and state geologist, Eugene Allen Smith, directed students on field trips throughout the state where they collected many new specimens and met persons who also contributed to the collections.  Dr. Adiel A. Klompmaker, a specialist in Decapods, is the current Curator of Paleontology.  The Invertebrate Paleontology Collection is estimated to contain over 20,000 lots of specimens, although only 4,000 are catalogued. Specimens are mainly from the Oligocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous deposits of Alabama. The Paleogene (Eocene plus Oligocene) deposits in Alabama are considered to be among the best in the world.  The Vertebrate Paleontology Collection consists of over 10,000+ catalogued items, most of which consist of individual specimens. The collection contains items from the Pennsylvanian, Cretaceous and Paleogene deposits of Alabama, but focuses primarily on Cretaceous and Eocene marine formations. The vertebrate collections have strong representation of Cretaceous mosasaurs, Eocene whales, and Pennsylvanian trackways from the Union Chapel Mine trackway site.  The Paleobotany Collection consists of over 700 specimens catalogued, mostly from the Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous of Alabama, as well as petrified wood from Arizona.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Adiel A.

The collection has significant systematic and taxonomic value in that it contains over 200 holotypes, including 183 bird and 48 mammal taxa.  In addition, the bird collection houses large numbers of specimens from many now-degraded habitats in Mexico and northern Central America, including a significant series by Thomas R. Howell of passerine birds inhabiting the lowland pine savannas of northeastern Nicaragua taken from the 1950s through the 1970s (Ornithological Monograph No. 68).  It also contains a small but important series of an endemic seabird, the Tristramâs Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma tristrami), and endemic land birds from the Hawaiian Islands, including the Laysan Finch (Telespiza cantans), and the Millerbird (Acrocephalus familiaris) as well as an important series of the extinct Passenger Pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) from the late 1870s and several California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus) from the very early 1900s.","cataloguedSpecimens":70000,"contact":"Kathy C.

The collection spans 1870 to the present, is worldwide in coverage, and includes specimens from the three major extant mammalian lineages (monotremes, marsupials, and placentals) distributed across 21 orders, 266 genera, and 381 species. Specimen records are databased in Arctos and also accessible through GBIF, iDigBio, VertNet, Map of Life, BISON, GGBN, and GenBank. The collectionâs primary strength is its focus on the southern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains. Approximately 82% of the collection is from the western United States, with specimens from Colorado (73%) representing the largest percentage. Small mammals, such as shrews, rodents, lagomorphs, and bats, constitute the majority (84%) of specimens in the collection. The composition of the collection is primarily study skins and skeletal material, with a growing wet collection. High-quality specimen data, frozen tissues, and parasites are associated with most of the specimens archived since 2006.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"Mammalia","contact":"John Demboski","lat":39.747560,"lon":-104.942850,"institution_code":"DMNS","collection_code":"DMNS:Mamm, ZM.","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:9754f201-6b00-431e-b16d-110ad4c8a4e7","collection_url":"https://www.dmns.org/science/zoology/zoology-collections/mammals/","collection_catalog_url":"https://arctos.database.museum/SpecimenSearch.cfm?guid_prefix=DMNS%3AMamm","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"john.demboski@dmns.org","mailing_address":"2001 Colorado Blvd","mailing_city":"Denver","mailing_state":"Colorado","mailing_zip":"80205","physical_address":"2001 Colorado Blvd","physical_city":"Denver","physical_state":"Colorado","physical_zip":"80205","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:75a457ae-5214-4b6a-9eab-178d6cf4a780"},{"institutionKey":"07fca7f1-4462-4b90-a2e7-4bef9e76b34b","collectionKey":"7132b8fd-31bb-4512-86fa-fab340ad83e5","institution":"Springfield Science Museum","collection":"Mammalogy","description":"Full mounts, study skins, skeletal material","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Dave Stier","lat":42.104400,"lon":-72.588200,"institution_code":"SPR, SSM","collection_code":"SSM","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:a3b78240-e302-4838-96cc-5d7675b533ea","contact_email":"dstier@springfieldmuseums.org","mailing_address":"21 Edwards Street","mailing_city":"Springfield","mailing_state":"Massachusetts","mailing_zip":"01103-0000","physical_address":"21 Edwards Street","physical_city":"Springfield","physical_state":"Massachusetts","physical_zip":"01103-0000"},{"institutionKey":"0456a041-521d-4f07-8e86-dd0b78e8948e","collectionKey":"a2681547-0c73-44d8-b2d8-fb69383e8c62","institution":"University of Alabama","collection":"Herbarium","recordsets":"5ddcbd44-1802-46b0-bae5-11126409c03d","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"5ddcbd44-1802-46b0-bae5-11126409c03d\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":79000,"taxonCoverage":"Aquatic plants, especially neotropical Alismatidae; neotropical Gesneriaceae","contact":"Michael McKain","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=126580","lat":33.209335,"lon":-87.539314,"institution_code":"UNA, ALU","collection_code":"UNA","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:583d5616-49bd-4a3e-bbe0-011cd048e19b","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:15757","collection_url":"http://herbarium.as.ua.edu","geographic_range":"Alabama","contact_role":"Collections Manager","contact_email":"mrmckain@ua.edu","mailing_address":"Box 870344","mailing_city":"Tuscaloosa","mailing_state":"Alabama","mailing_zip":"35487-0344","physical_address":"Mary Harmon Bryant HallHackberry Lane.","physical_city":"Tuscaloosa","physical_state":"Alabama","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:5dd09d1d-f23a-481d-b232-a0ac19664dc1"},{"institutionKey":"94883c0f-ab3d-4ad3-9007-9386b8a0f941","collectionKey":"48e0e4ef-22db-4dc6-bfbf-fde43a121937","institution":"L.C.

In addition to California, there are specimens from Oregon, Washington, Alaska, north central and northeast United States, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Pacific Mexico, Chile, Great Britain, Jamaica, Japan, New Zealand, Queensland, Scandinavia, Spain, South Africa, South Australia, and Tasmania.","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"wahlert@ccber.ucsb.edu","mailing_address":"Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration, Harder South, Building 578, MS-9615, University of California Santa Barbara","mailing_city":"Santa Barbara","mailing_state":"California","mailing_zip":"93106","physical_address":"Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration, Harder South, Building 578, MS-9615, University of California Santa Barbara","physical_city":"Santa Barbara","physical_state":"California","physical_zip":"93106","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:2a74fd30-dea3-4927-8bd7-3c1a275da8ae"},{"institutionKey":"45fdee73-1717-4ade-a868-5ee8bdc7c81f","collectionKey":"4a4980bb-08b4-4f0f-b919-e4c732637007","institution":"Granite Mountains Desert Research Center","collection":"Herbarium","cataloguedSpecimens":10800,"taxonCoverage":"Vascular Plants, Lichens, Bryophytes","contact":"Tasha La Doux","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=155881","lat":35.012329,"lon":-115.653450,"institution_code":"GMDRC","collection_code":"GMDRC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:d80a1743-39d0-4f54-a272-83939ce42f30","geographic_range":"Mojave, Great Basin, and Sonoran Deserts, Sierra Nevada, Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, with the primary focus on the east Mojave Desert of California.","contact_role":"Assistant Director","contact_email":"gmdrc@ucr.edu","mailing_address":"University of California Natural Reserve System,HC1 Box 101","mailing_city":"Kelso","mailing_state":"California","mailing_zip":"92309","physical_state":"California"},{"institutionKey":"7c3886bd-aad4-4908-97c0-8370f150baaf","collectionKey":"10b2a9fd-c4ce-447a-affe-bbc444187b21","institution":"North Carolina Arboretum, Germplasm Repository","collection":"North Carolina Arboretum, Germplasm Repository","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Joe-Ann McCoy","lat":35.583000,"lon":-82.552900,"institution_code":"null","collection_code":"null","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:73baa04e-8e77-477d-9968-e3eabca72c5f","collection_url":"http://www.ncarboretum.org/research/the-north-carolina-arboretum-germplasm-repository/","contact_role":"Director","contact_email":"jmccoy@ncarboretum.org","mailing_address":"100 Frederick Law Olmsted Way","mailing_city":"Asheville","mailing_state":"North Carolina","mailing_zip":"28806-9315","physical_address":"100 Frederick Law Olmsted Way","physical_city":"Asheville","physical_state":"North Carolina","physical_zip":"28806-9315"},{"institutionKey":"e329699d-6a66-4a0b-bd6a-8089f2eb2aa1","collectionKey":"dd8d20a6-ba2b-4961-bd14-c227e24be1e0","institution":"Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History","collection":"Ichthyology Collection","recordsets":"9d8ced48-62c5-4ce0-99e7-a03550c674c0","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":[\"9d8ced48-62c5-4ce0-99e7-a03550c674c0\"],\"collectioncode\":[\"fh\"]}","description":"Small regional comparative collection of 2,000 specimens including voucher collections from Oil Platforms Hermosa and Hidalgo.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Paul W.

The collection has an emphasis on freshwater fishes of the central United States and also has significant marine and estuarine collections. The fish collection has representation from 3171 taxa (297 families and 1262 genera) and 79 countries including Ecuador, Fiji, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua and various marine localities. The collections and the scope of research activities in the division continue to grow due to the ongoing activities of ichthyology staff and students.\n\nThe collection is used by national and international researchers as well as by state and federal agencies. The Division of Ichthyology is designated as a Regional Center in the Midwest and Great Plains Regions (Collette &amp; Lachner 1976, Copeia 1976: 625-642; Poss and Collette 1995, Copeia 1995: 48-70) and is among the top twenty ichthyological collections in the country. Almost 60% of the specimens in the collection are from the Great Plains Region. The collection is an important resource for anyone interested in the region&#39;s fishes. The data concerning these faunas are not extensively duplicated by other ichthyological collections.\n\nThe Ichthyology collection comprises whole, wet, voucher specimens in 70% ethanol (98%), specimens maintained as dry skeletons (0.3%) and cleared and stained preparations in glycerine (1.7%). Other ancillary collections include a large slide and digital image collection of specimens and locations (some of which are linked to specimen records through the database), a large field note collection and a map collection.\n\nThe wet specimens are housed in a state-of-the-art fluid collection facility, opened in 1996. The facility has 2,400 square feet of collection storage space on four floors and is shared with Herpetology, Mammalogy, Ornithology, Entomology and Invertebrate Zoology. The collection storage environment is maintained at 65Â°F year-round by an HVAC system. Specimens are housed in state of the art glassware and stainless steel tanks and protected by a sprinkler fire suppression system and UV-shielded lighting. The division has both morphological research facilities and a shared molecular systematic laboratory.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"ActinistiaActinopterygiiCephalaspidomorphiElasmobranchiiMyxiniSarcopterygii","contact":"William Leo Smith","lat":38.957400,"lon":-95.245900,"institution_code":"KU, KANU","collection_code":"KUI","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:f50da0e9-cfe3-4d2a-af93-c20a8864602b","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/a2i3-djem","collection_url":"http://biodiversity.ku.edu/ichthyology/collections","collection_catalog_url":"http://collections.biodiversity.ku.edu/KU_Fish_voucher/","geographic_range":"The fish collection has representation from 79 countries including Ecuador, Fiji, Mexico, Nepal, Nicaragua and various marine localities.","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"leosmith@ku.edu","mailing_address":"Biodiversity Institute, Dyche Hall, 1345 Jayhawk Boulevard","mailing_city":"Lawrence","mailing_state":"KS","mailing_zip":"66045","physical_address":"Biodiversity Institute, Dyche Hall, 1345 Jayhawk Boulevard","physical_city":"Lawrence, KS","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:356736e8-9e70-4516-bf04-1ad72ca6604f"},{"institutionKey":"c3b796b8-3771-4df1-a23a-aea71328d487","collectionKey":"8ca3b91b-a0fd-4734-a29e-c4f6b8d26f85","institution":"Saint Michael's College","collection":"Herbarium","cataloguedSpecimens":1000,"contact":"Peter Hope","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=125846","lat":44.495849,"lon":-73.163605,"institution_code":"SMCW","collection_code":"SMCW","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:113f3aff-26f4-4202-bcb5-4471b00b4867","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:13970","geographic_range":"Vermont.","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"phope@smcvt.edu","mailing_address":"Biology Dept., Box 283\nOne Winooski Park","mailing_city":"Colchester","mailing_state":"Vermont","mailing_zip":"05439","physical_city":"Colchester","physical_state":"Vermont"},{"institutionKey":"8054213e-bc75-40a1-98a2-997945147e4f","collectionKey":"2009c1e1-19dd-4ac9-9c08-bbf600237673","institution":"Oregon State University","collection":"Ichthyology","recordsets":"4a1f1862-cb5f-42c5-b3c8-bfc51b1fd140","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"4a1f1862-cb5f-42c5-b3c8-bfc51b1fd140\"}","description":"Pacific Northwest and North Pacific Worldwide","cataloguedSpecimens":19354,"taxonCoverage":"Pacific Northwest and North Pacific","contact":"Brian Sidlauskas","institution_code":"OS","collection_code":"OS","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:4c100664-54a2-4e03-99c6-220bdd1403a8","collection_url":"http://ichthyology.oregonstate.edu","collection_catalog_url":"http://www.fishnet2.net/search.aspx?c=os","geographic_range":"Worldwide","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"brian.sidlauskas@oregonstate.edu","mailing_address":"Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, 104 Nash Hall","mailing_city":"Corvallis","mailing_state":"Oregon","mailing_zip":"97330","physical_address":"Nash Hall, Department of Fisheries & Wildlife","physical_city":"Corvallis","physical_state":"Oregon","physical_zip":"97331","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:121e84fb-8c8b-45d3-b93c-6c3985f660c3"},{"institutionKey":"07bba8b3-fc1d-4983-b9de-39c13d9d1232","collectionKey":"01ed8cc9-c5fd-438a-8f38-08a8f74498d5","institution":"Louisiana State University, Musuem of Zoology","collection":"Ichthyology","recordsets":"6d9d4f55-4cb4-4c8f-acc7-b465eb5f703c","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"6d9d4f55-4cb4-4c8f-acc7-b465eb5f703c\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Prosanta Chakrabarty","institution_code":"LSUMZ","collection_code":"LSUMZ","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:77e0f1f6-3e72-4113-ade7-7f83b4694a4d","collection_url":"http://appl003.lsu.edu/natsci/lmns.nsf/$Content/Fishes?OpenDocument","collection_catalog_url":"http://appl024.lsu.edu/natsci%5CCollections%5Cnatscicolsearch.nsf/OpenMainPage?OpenAgent&ID=1068","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"prosanta@lsu.edu","mailing_address":"119 Foster Hall, Louisiana State University","mailing_city":"Baton Rouge","mailing_state":"Louisiana","mailing_zip":"70803","physical_address":"119 Foster Hall, Louisiana State University","physical_city":"Baton Rouge","physical_state":"Louisiana","physical_zip":"70803","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:ecfba5c5-0fb4-4f5d-93bc-990238b33589"},{"institutionKey":"6ad369d0-5b88-4453-818c-e5e74535974b","collectionKey":"5568162f-c866-4904-8714-86cad5b8c510","institution":"Bucknell University","collection":"Herbarium","cataloguedSpecimens":20000,"taxonCoverage":"Vascular plants; Juglandaceae","contact":"Christopher T.

Gloyd (b. 1902) conducted fieldwork on Odonata. Orlando Park published on the taxonomy and ecology of Coleoptera, particularly the Pselaphidae, in the 1940s. Stanley Auerbach researched centipedes in the Chicago area during the 1950s. Other major collectors include Andrew Bolter (collected between 1879-1910) and Harry D. Sicher (collected between 1940 and 1970), both of whom collected primarily Lepidoptera. The majority of the non-Lepidopteran specimens were collected in the Midwest and Western Great Lakes regions, with Canada, California, Florida, and the Southwestern U.S. also represented. Lepidoptera primarily include species from the Midwestern U.S. as well as Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Alaska, California, Florida, and the Southwestern U.S. Temporal Coverage of this collection is 1834-Present, with the bulk of the non-Lepidoptera specimens collected between 1872 and 1911, and the bulk of Lepidopteran specimens collected between 1891 and 1964.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"Majority of collection consists of Lepidoptera.

The Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) collection and the orphaned University of Illinois Museum of Natural History Collection (UIMNH).     The Illinois Natural History Survey Mollusk Collection contains over 190,000 catalogued specimens in nearly 50,000 lots, most of which were collected in Illinois and the southeastern United States. The collection is about 95% freshwater bivalves and gastropods (mussels, fingernail clams, and snails), 1% land snails and 4% marine gastropods, almost all of which are cones. Most of the specimens were collected as a result of various faunal surveys conducted by INHS biologists from the late 1800&#39;s until the present. The early collections were made by such naturalists as John Wesley Powell, Robert Kennicott, Richard E. Call, William A. Nason, Frank C. Baker, Robert E. Richardson, and Charles A. Hart.     The University of Illinois Museum of Natural History Collection contains over 250,000 catalogued specimens in nearly 32,000 lots, and is global in scope with significant holdings of freshwater and terrestrial species from North and Central America. The collection is about 35% freshwater bivalves and gastropods, 35% land snails and 30% marine bivalves and gastropods.     Together the collections have over 80,000 lots (58,000 FW, 12,000 marine &amp; and 10,000 landsnails) and nearly 450,000 specimens. Over 135 countries are represented, but the collection is especially strong in freshwater mollusks from the Midwest and Southeastern United States and land snails from Southwestern United States and Central America. Over 40,000 soft parts of more than 200 species have been preserved (approximately half in ethanol) and available for study.  All specimens that can be geo-referenced have been assigned latitude and longitudinal coordinates.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Kevin S.

Roosevelt, the Patuxent Research Refuge is the nation's only national wildlife refuge established to support wildlife research. It is located located between Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD. At the time of the Refuge's establishment in 1936, botanist Neil Hotchkiss and other scientists surveyed the flora on the 2,650 acres which made up the Refuge. Lists of plants found on the Refuge were published in 1940 and 1947. The latter list tabulated 944 plant taxa. Voucher specimens were collected and reposited in the Refuge's herbarium. By 1980, when the refuge expanded to 4,741 acres, a total of 900 plant taxa were listed. In the early 1990's as part of the Base Re-alignment and Closure (BRAC) process, the Department of Defense transferred about 8,100 acres of land from Fort Meade to the Department of Interior, with control of the land given to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The addition of this parcel, now known as the North Tract, brought the total acreage of the Refuge to over 12,800 acres. A floral survey of the North Tract began in 2010 and a re-survey of the older parcel of the Refuge, known as the Central and South Tracts, was initiated in 2013. As of December 2017, the herbarium holds almost 5,000 voucher specimens from over 1,250 taxa found on the Refuge. This includes a number of Maryland rare, threatened, and endangered (RTE) species, as well as at least five species new to Maryland. A number of duplicate and unique voucher specimens are held by other herbaria.","cataloguedSpecimens":5330,"taxonCoverage":"Vascular plants, smaller numbers of bryophytes, etc.","contact":"Elaine

Collections originated as departmental teaching and research collections in the early 1960s. Between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, the collections were formalized under the name Museum of Arid Land Biology (acronym MALB). In 1976, organizational changes instituted by the university resulted in the renaming of the collections and associated activities as the Laboratory for Environmental Biology (acronym UTEP, though locally called the &quot;LEB&quot;). In July of 1993, the Laboratory became associated with the University of Texas at El Paso&#39;s Centennial Museum through a memorandum of understanding.  Curated specimens form the base for research by Centennial Museum personnel and faculty curators; by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso; and, through loans and visitation, graduate students and professionals from other institutions. The name was changed to UTEP Biodiversity Collections in August of 2012.

Between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, the collections were formalized under the name Museum of Arid Land Biology (acronym MALB). In 1976, organizational changes instituted by the university resulted in the renaming of the collections and associated activities as the Laboratory for Environmental Biology (acronym UTEP, though locally called the &quot;LEB&quot;). In July of 1993, the Laboratory became associated with the University of Texas at El Paso&#39;s Centennial Museum through a memorandum of understanding.  Curated specimens form the base for research by Centennial Museum personnel and faculty curators; by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso; and, through loans and visitation, graduate students and professionals from other institutions. The name was changed to UTEP Biodiversity Collections in August of 2012.  Collections primarily are of modern and fossil vertebrate biology (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and have a regional emphasis, but also contain material from outside the Southwest, particularly from Mexico. The research collections are maintained in the Biology Building.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Teresa Mayfield","lat":31.770000,"lon":-106.505400,"institution_code":"UTEP","collection_code":"Earth Science, ES","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:8d929577-4a06-4830-bc4f-053edbe3cdb9","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/hhpv-heav","collection_catalog_url":"http://arctos.database.museum/home.cfm#UTEP","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"tmayfield@utep.edu","mailing_address":"500 W.

It currently holds over 100,000 specimens with a worldwide distribution, representing all vertebrate classes from the Silurian to the Pleistocene. This collection was acquired primarily through over a century of field work by section staff and associates as well as acquisitions by the Museum. Fossil collecting began in 1895 with the sponsorship of Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who supported the museum&rsquo;s numerous early expeditions to the American West that resulted in one of the best dinosaur collections in the world. Carnegie in his retirement further strengthened the collection with the purchase in 1903 of a large collection of Paleozoic-Cenozoic, European fossils from the Baron de Bayet, a private fossil collector from Brussels, Belgium. Strengths of the collection include Mississippian fishes from Bear Gulch, Montana; Pennsylvanian and Permian fishes, amphibians and reptiles from Pennsylvania, Ohio,  West Virginia and the southwestern United States; Jurassic dinosaurs, especially sauropods, from Utah (Dinosaur National Monument) and Wyoming; Jurassic fishes and reptiles from Germany and France; Eocene fishes from Monte Bolca, Italy; Eocene and Oligocene tetrapods, from Montana, Wyoming and Utah; Miocene mammals from a site now preserved as Agate Springs Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska; and Pleistocene vertebrates from the Appalachian region.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Amy Henrici","lat":40.444012,"lon":-79.950363,"institution_code":"CM, CMNH","collection_code":"CM","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:e86de8ad-fde7-423b-bb5d-32bfbefbb35b","collection_url":"https://carnegiemnh.org/research/vertebrate-paleontology/","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"henricia@carnegiemnh.org","mailing_address":"4400 Forbes Avenue","mailing_city":"Pittsburgh","mailing_state":"Pennsylvania","mailing_zip":"15213","physical_address":"4400 Forbes Avenue","physical_city":"Pittsburgh","physical_state":"Pennsylvania","physical_zip":"15213","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:806b335a-9236-425e-a8be-21eb9772e657"},{"institutionKey":"ba3e8f5b-b023-41e1-8d4b-c032668b8121","collectionKey":"5ca695b7-d519-4f60-9f80-c91ebed6de63","institution":"Angelo State University","collection":"Angelo State University Herbarium","description":"Poaceae, Cyperaceae West Texas","cataloguedSpecimens":79000,"taxonCoverage":"Vascular plants","contact":"Bonnie B.

We now have over 100,000 insect and spider compression fossils from Creede, Florissant, Green River, Latah, and Pitch Pinnacle Formations as well as Cockerell&#39;s fossil insect collections from Argentina and Siberia. Cockerell, Lanham, and Rohwer collected much of the fossil insect material in the early 1900s, and new material is now being collected and accessioned into our holdings from the Green River Formation of Colorado.We also possess a large collection of over 3,400 fossil insects and spiders preserved in copal and amber from Madagascar, Colombia, and the Baltics.     \tImportant Marine and Terrestrial Invertebrates  In addition to our focus on terrestrial arthropods, we also have a collection of Mesozoic and Cenozoic invertebrate fossils from the Rocky Mountain Region that is one of the most extensive in the country. In total, we have approximately 280,000 marine invertebrate specimens, including 316 holotypes. Notable marine invertebrate material in our collections includes Dr. Eicher&#39;s foraminifera assemblages from the Cretaceous interior of North America. Not only have important holotypes been identified from this material, these foram assemblages have also been important in reconstructing the flow of water in the interior seaway (Eicher 1977; Hay et al. 1993).

The collections and the scope of research activities in the division continue to grow due to the ongoing activities of ichthyology staff and students.\n\nThe collection is used by national and international researchers as well as by state and federal agencies. The Division of Ichthyology is designated as a Regional Center in the Midwest and Great Plains Regions (Collette &amp; Lachner 1976, Copeia 1976: 625-642; Poss and Collette 1995, Copeia 1995: 48-70) and is among the top twenty ichthyological collections in the country. Almost 60% of the specimens in the collection are from the Great Plains Region. The collection is an important resource for anyone interested in the region&#39;s fishes. The data concerning these faunas are not extensively duplicated by other ichthyological collections.\n\nThe tissue collection comprises tissue samples originally collected in liquid nitrogen, DMSO and ethanol and stored in state-of-the-art liquid nitrogen dewars at -170Â°C.

The most common preparation type is a prepared skin, with the skull cleaned and stored in a separated container (our preparation code is SS).  Second-most common is a skin with the entire skeleton cleaned and stored separately (SB).  Some specimens consist only of a skull (SK) or cranium (CO).  Other specimens may consist of a partial skeleton (PS), an entire skeleton (SN) or only a skin (SO).  Many of our specimens are stored in alcohol (AL), or are in alcohol with the skull removed and cleaned (SA).  Tissues associated with any of these preparation types are noted as a separate field in our database.  Because there are active public education and exhibits programs in the KU Natural History Museum, a few of our specimens are taxidermy mounts (BM) and some are housed permanently on exhibit.  Other preparation types are coded as âotherâ (OT).  Occasionally, specimens are prepared with the baculum or os clitoris and separately stored in preserving fluid.  Non-standard preparation types and additional materials are noted in a comments field in our database.<br><br>\n\n\nWe have extensive historical collections from Central America, Mexico, and southeast, central, western regions of the United States and Alaska.  We recently added outstanding collections from the Philippines and New Guinea.  We anticipate continuing to maintain our strengths in these geographic regions, emphasizing bats, rodents and insectivoresâcurrent taxonomic strengths.  Most of our collection consists of nicely prepared skins, skulls, and complete skeletons, with most recent specimens accompanied by tissues.<br><br>\n\nThere are 135 type specimens in our collection at present.  Of these, the largest number (97) are rodents.  There are also 6 insectivore, 25 bat, 5 lagomorph, and 2 carnivore holotypes.  Lists of the Mammalogy's type specimens have been published by Jones and Genoways (1969) and Jones et al. (1984), although several have been described since.  Types have been described from Barbados, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (14 states), Mozambique, Nicaragua, Philippines, Venezuela, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and from 12 states in the U.S.  All type specimens are kept in the designated \"type case\" at all times.  Use of type specimens must be arranged with the curators.<br> <br>\n\nThere is broad taxonomic coverage, including important holdings of Central and South American marsupials, insectivores, bats, rodents; Holarctic shrews, microtines, squirrels and North American bats, insectivores, carnivores, rodents and lagomorphs.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"","contact":"Andrew Bentley","lat":38.957400,"lon":-95.245900,"institution_code":"KU, KANU","collection_code":"KUM","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:3478451c-907d-4e41-83b8-cb2c1791bb2e","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/wxsq-c7ia","collection_url":"http://biodiversity.ku.edu/mammalogy/collections","collection_catalog_url":"http://collections.biodiversity.ku.edu/KUMammals","geographic_range":"","contact_role":"Bioinformatics Manager","contact_email":"abentley@ku.edu","mailing_address":"Biodiversity Institute, Dyche Hall, 1345 Jayhawk Boulevard","mailing_city":"Lawrence","mailing_state":"KS","mailing_zip":"66045","physical_address":"Biodiversity Institute, Dyche Hall, 1345 Jayhawk Boulevard","physical_city":"Lawrence, KS","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:356736e8-9e70-4516-bf04-1ad72ca6604f"},{"institutionKey":"40a92a7d-d0e0-4eb7-9369-39b754dde3f2","collectionKey":"88cd9d82-a6e4-4784-af28-f007c1e02f68","institution":"Bureau of Land Management, Taos Field District Office","collection":"Herbarium","recordsets":"997c4dda-0465-40c0-af8d-67f8f90dea3b","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"997c4dda-0465-40c0-af8d-67f8f90dea3b\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Lillis Urban","lat":36.386900,"lon":-105.581000,"institution_code":"BLM","collection_code":"TAFO","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:3f22c204-cabe-474c-b201-62ec4c156ae4","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"lurban@blm.gov","mailing_address":"226 Cruz Alta Road","mailing_city":"Taos","mailing_state":"New Mexico","mailing_zip":"87571-5983","physical_address":"226 Cruz Alta Road","physical_city":"Taos","physical_state":"New Mexico","physical_zip":"87571-5983"},{"institutionKey":"ddd124e8-b20e-40c6-81a3-00ab72981ba7","collectionKey":"62006959-5a79-4318-9dd0-72d56bd3237d","institution":"Hymenoptera Institute Collection, University of Kentucky","collection":"Entomology","recordsets":"d315c4a3-0bee-49d1-8d03-726358937cde","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"d315c4a3-0bee-49d1-8d03-726358937cde\"}","description":"Braconidae, especially Agathidinae world distribution","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"Braconidae, especially Agathidinae","contact":"Eric Chapman","institution_code":"UKY-HIC, HIC","collection_code":"HIC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:66e8279a-250f-4480-aa31-aac681e7ca26","collection_url":"http://sharkeylab.org/sharkeylab/","collection_catalog_url":"http://symbiota4.acis.ufl.edu/scan/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=44","geographic_range":"World","contact_role":"Research Analyst","contact_email":"ericgchapman@gmail.com","mailing_address":"Department of Entomology, S-225 Agricultural Science Center N","mailing_city":"Lexington","mailing_state":"Kentucky","mailing_zip":"40456-0091","physical_address":"Department of Entomology, S-225 Agricultural Science Center N","physical_city":"Lexington","physical_state":"Kentucky","physical_zip":"40456-0091","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:6eebc307-c784-4339-86c7-88d5e918ba78"},{"institutionKey":"abe356aa-1117-46ed-b00f-ea9a7c983538","collectionKey":"c6d6cecb-fb20-463a-a707-b2676443d1b0","institution":"Norwich University","collection":"Herbarium","description":"The collection includes only vascular plants.

The Division houses more than 22 million specimens, which comprises about 500,000 species. Most of these specimens are terrestrial arthropods, but there are large collections of marine and freshwater invertebrates. Strengths of the collections reflect the research of current and past curators: Arachnids (especially spiders and scorpions), aculeate (sting-bearing) Hymenoptera (including bees, wasps and ants), gall wasps (Cynipoidea), certain Diptera (especially Drosophilidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae), Hemiptera, Isoptera (termites) and their symbiotic protists, macro-Lepidoptera (particularly of the New World), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), the primitively wingless insects (bristletails and silverfish), marine Mollusca, and fossils in amber. Research centers around field exploration, the collections, and laboratory studies using morphology and DNA sequences to examine the evolutionary relationships of a spectrum of groups from species to phyla.","cataloguedSpecimens":691078,"taxonCoverage":"Hemiptera, Cynipidae, Wasp Collection, Araneae, Apoidea, Amber, Scorpions, Mollusca, Cnidaria, Annelida","contact":"Christine Johnson (general)","lat":40.786000,"lon":-73.968400,"institution_code":"AMNH","collection_code":"IZC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:fa60c2cd-29bd-4f76-a338-12fe7f8024d9","collection_url":"http://www.amnh.org/our-research/invertebrate-zoology/collections","collection_catalog_url":"https://www.amnh.org/our-research/invertebrate-zoology/resources/collections-databases","geographic_range":"World-wide","contact_role":"Curatorial Associate","contact_email":"cjohnson@amnh.org","mailing_address":"Central Park West at 79th Str.","mailing_city":"New York","mailing_zip":"10024","physical_address":"Central Park West at 79th Str.","physical_city":"New York","physical_state":"NY","physical_zip":"10024","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:a312a5eb-8a63-4ef7-b57c-6bbea34f37c3"},{"institutionKey":"e152e570-db64-46ee-9dfb-4b68fb928110","collectionKey":"cdafa93a-27b1-4dc9-9217-80eb2b2b72f9","institution":"Klamath Falls Resource Area, BLM","collection":"Herbarium","description":"1796 vascular plants, 630 cryptogams","cataloguedSpecimens":2426,"taxonCoverage":"1796 vascular plants, 630 cryptogams","contact":"Kerry A.

Most specimens are from the southwestern United States; however considerable representative material is also available from other North American regions and Mexico. The collection was largely developed through the activities of past faculty - Drs. Frank Hasbrouck, Gordon Castle and Mont Cazier - and their students. The O'Brien Insect Collection, recently donated to ASU, adds ca. 1.25Mio specimens to this collection, approx. 1 million weevils and 250,000 grasshoppers (see https://asunow.asu.edu/20170323-arizona-impact-obrien-insect-collection-donating-asu).An extensive reprint collection is available to visiting researchers.

Between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, the collections were formalized under the name Museum of Arid Land Biology (acronym MALB). In 1976, organizational changes instituted by the university resulted in the renaming of the collections and associated activities as the Laboratory for Environmental Biology (acronym UTEP, though locally called the &quot;LEB&quot;). In July of 1993, the Laboratory became associated with the University of Texas at El Paso&#39;s Centennial Museum through a memorandum of understanding. Curated specimens form the base for research by Centennial Museum personnel and faculty curators; by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso; and, through loans and visitation, graduate students and professionals from other institutions.

These include late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic reptiles and amphibians, representing some of the earliest fully terrestrial vertebrate communities. Collections also include large early Cenozoic mammal collections from the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming used to document some of the best known cases of gradual evolutionary change over geological time. The museum holds unique specimens representing the early diversification of primates and whales, including numerous steps in the evolutionary transition of whales from terrestrial mammals with hindlimbs to aquatic animals lacking external hindlimbs. Important collections of late Cenozoic fishes demonstrate long records of diversification within major lacustrine systems. Finally, late Cenozoic mammal collections include the best record of human association with extinct Ice Age mastodons found anywhere on the continent.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Daniel Fisher","institution_code":"UMMP","collection_code":"UM, UMMP","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:2b924478-0e2d-4984-8425-cc920b37b5e9","collection_url":"https://lsa.umich.edu/paleontology/collections/vertebrate-paleontology-collection.html","geographic_range":"Global","contact_role":"Curator & Director","contact_email":"dcfisher@umich.edu","mailing_address":"3600 Varsity Drive","mailing_city":"Ann Arbor","mailing_state":"Michigan","mailing_zip":"48108","physical_address":"3600 Varsity Drive","physical_city":"Ann Arbor","physical_state":"Michigan","physical_zip":"48108"},{"institutionKey":"c575d985-4c3f-43d5-8c43-a6afa0f7fc52","collectionKey":"d849dd03-ebce-4978-b73c-000649cf1f44","institution":"Southwestern Oklahoma State University","collection":"Entomology","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Rickey Cothran","lat":35.532505,"lon":-98.700569,"institution_code":"WOH","collection_code":"WOH","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:5c18197c-790d-4c5d-9329-f2655ad663c5","contact_email":"rickey.cothran@swosu.edu","mailing_address":"Biology Department","mailing_city":"Weatherford","mailing_state":"Oklahoma","mailing_zip":"73096-3098","physical_city":"Weatherford","physical_state":"Oklahoma","physical_zip":"73096-3098"},{"institutionKey":"322c61b5-27e6-4c4e-b066-1246ac2f1ca4","collectionKey":"432fd163-eb0e-463b-b147-e26e8b8c918d","institution":"Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History","collection":"Genomic Resources","recordsets":"6e6e2b47-fa3e-4bd9-8f1c-105b741d31df","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"6e6e2b47-fa3e-4bd9-8f1c-105b741d31df\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Janet K.

The dried skin and skeletal preparations are stored in 732 metal cabinets. These cabinets are specially designed to keep the specimens safe from UV light, dust, occasional insect pests, and other harmful agents. Every specimen is labeled with information concerning its species, sex, collector, preparator, collecting location, and other pieces of collecting data. Each specimen has also been given a catalog number and its data verified and entered into a searchable computer database. All specimens of the same species are stored together, organized by country, state, county, and finally catalog number. Groups of related species are housed in adjacent cases. As with the Genetic Resources Collection, the majority of these specimens in this collection are bar coded and a project is underway to bar code the rest to facilitate the retrieval of associated data and to reduce time and effort spent by the NSRL staff in maintaining an organized collection","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Heath Garner","lat":33.590161,"lon":-101.885810,"institution_code":"TTU","collection_code":"TTU","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:51793bf4-84e9-4992-8f72-ff3cf5303589","collection_url":"http://www.depts.ttu.edu/nsrl/collections/mammal.php","collection_catalog_url":"http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/search/index.htm","geographic_range":"The mammal collection represents a permanent record of the natural history of the Lubbock area, Texas, and the United States in general.

All pinned or pointed specimens are stored in 21 Cornell or U.S. National Museum (12 drawers each) insect cabinets. Three of these cabinets contains study specimens of all major orders and families of insects and are directly accessible by students for study and reference purposes. In addition, five vial cabinets (10 drawers each) are for storage of specimens preserved in alcohol.. The collection also has approximately 1200 microscope slides that have been purchased commercially, prepared by students or the result of research projects. Total numbers of pinned or pointed specimens for major groups of insects in the collection are: Coleoptera 7025; Lepidoptera 3293; Diptera 2754; Hymenoptera 2533; Hemiptera 2615; Orthoptera 771; and Odonata 394. Some adults of these and other Orders are preserved in alcohol.  There are approximately 10,000 vials with alcohol-preserved adult and immature specimens. Most of these vials have multiple specimens and no attempt has been made to count each specimen. Many of the alcohol-preserved specimens are aquatic immature insects. There are several thousand specimens of Chironomidae larvae resulting from a multiple-year study of chironomid populations in Lake Winnebago and the feeding habits of lake sturgeon. The collection also includes approximately 9,000 Australian specimens most of which are aquatic species, especially Trichoptera larvae (3,922 specimens), all of which are identified to family and many to species. Essentially all specimens have appropriate collection data labels. Many of the specimens were donated by students enrolled in the entomology classes. Most of these are local, regional or state specimens. However, specimens have been collected throughout the U.S. In 2011 the UWOIC became a part of a regional (22 midwestern collections) digitization effort (Invertnet) funded by NSFâs Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections. Currently about 5,000 specimens have been digitized for this on-going project.","cataloguedSpecimens":200000,"contact":"Gene Drecktrah","lat":44.017761,"lon":-88.545097,"institution_code":"OSH, UWO","collection_code":"UWOIC","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:5002ccae-0483-11e5-b0ee-002315492bbc","collection_lsid":"http://www.uwosh.edu/biology/department-facilities/insect-collection-and-museum-1","contact_role":"Curator Emeritus","contact_email":"drecktra@uwosh.edu","mailing_address":"Department of Biology 800 Algoma Blvd.","mailing_city":"Oshkosh","mailing_state":"Wisconsin","mailing_zip":"54901","physical_address":"Halsey 142 921 Elmwood Ave.","physical_city":"Oshkosh","physical_state":"Wisconsin","physical_zip":"54901","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:8c02bca2-8bdc-4cd5-b25f-3938adc9cf17"},{"institutionKey":"d207ceed-42b6-4765-84e0-2b5e958a5c3e","collectionKey":"f0c0d65c-d86a-4e4c-bacb-e9c7963b0288","institution":"Michigan State University Museum","collection":"Ichthyology Research Collection","recordsets":"2b946e47-7b37-48dd-83bb-fd892c026f9f","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":[\"2b946e47-7b37-48dd-83bb-fd892c026f9f\"],\"collectioncode\":[\"IC\"]}","description":"The Ichthyology Research Collection includes 7,100 lots containing over 36,100 marine and freshwater specimens.

The collection is used extensively by most of the world's arachnologists. The geographic scope is worldwide, with special strengths in the New World. The AMNH also has the second-largest collection of scorpions, and the largest collection of minor arachnid orders in North America. The myriapod collections are also among the largest in North America. The collections include a worldwide representation of arachnid and myriapod taxa, with a strong emphasis on material from North America and elsewhere in the New World. The majority of specimens are preserved in ethanol, although large collections of slide-mounted Acari and pseudoscorpions are also represented. A small quantity of unsorted dried material, mostly from South America, is being rehydrated and transferred to ethanol. Collections are continually being augmented with new material collected by AMNH staff, or acquired as donations or purchases.In 2002, the arachnid and myriapod collections were transferred to a new storage facility within the AMNH, the Starr Natural Sciences building (NSB). In the NSB, specimens are stored in state-of-the-art cabinetry and a climate-controlled environment to ensure their longevity. A complete overhaul of the collection, whereby all old, unstandardized bottles and vials, many with bake-lite closures or rubber stoppers, are replaced by new glass jars of standardized volumes with polyethylene closures and polypropylene-foam liners, has been underway for several years. The entire collection is also gradually being databased, and archival data labels newly printed for each specimen-lot.Scorpions comprise the second largest component of the AMNH arachnid and myriapod collections, after spiders. Currently comprising over 30,000 specimen-lots, including several hundred type specimens, the AMNH has the fourth-largest scorpion collection in the world, including a vast array of New and Old World taxa. Several thousand specimens from South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, including numerous undescribed species, remain to be sorted and identified, and the collection continues to be increased as a result of active field projects. Particular strengths of the collections are in New World, and especially North American families. The AMNH has one of the two largest collections of vaejovid scorpions in the world (the California Academy of Sciences has the other). It incorporates the Oscar F. Francke collection, rich in vaejovid and iurid material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A., and containing many large series collected with U.V. light detection, but also containing material from elsewhere in the world. It also incorporates the Willis J. Gertsch collection, containing a significant amount of material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A. Recent acquisition of the Alexis Harington collection (ca. 10,000 specimens) vastly expanded the holdings of African material. Southern African taxa are particularly well represented in this collection, which comprises a more representative sample than most southern African collections. All families and genera, and most species of southern African scorpions are represented; including many rare or seldom collected species. Most species are represented by series from multiple localities, many representing new records and/or range extensions. In addition, there are reasonable holdings of extralimital African taxa, and taxa from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania. As part of Dr Prendini's research on the molecular systematics of scorpions, a synoptic collection of tissues from scorpions is steadily being deposited in the Ambrose Monell Collection for Molecular and Microbial Research of the AMNH. Developed through fieldwork and donations or exchanges with colleagues around the world, this collection is continually augmented and includes sizable holdings of tissue samples from Amblypygi, Schizomida, Solifugae and Thelyphonida and other arachnid and myriapod taxa, in addition to Scorpiones. Samples are housed at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-150Â°C) to maintain the highest quality and maximum stability of biomolecules indefinitely.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"World's largest collection of spiders and second largest collection of scorpions.","contact":"Lorenzo Prendini","lat":40.786000,"lon":-73.968400,"institution_code":"AMNH","collection_code":"AMNH","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:2f3ebf02-a833-4bf3-b0a9-0b7fe56aa6b5","collection_url":"http://www.amnh.org/our-research/invertebrate-zoology/collections/arachnida-non-spider-myriapoda","geographic_range":"Global, with strengths in the New World, North America and Africa.","contact_role":"Curator-in-charge","contact_email":"lorenzo@amnh.org","mailing_address":"Central Park West at 79th St","mailing_city":"New York","mailing_state":"New York","mailing_zip":"10024-5192","physical_address":"Central Park West at 79th St","physical_city":"New York","physical_state":"New York","physical_zip":"10024-5192","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:a312a5eb-8a63-4ef7-b57c-6bbea34f37c3"},{"institutionKey":"b9044994-9fe1-4c92-be3f-cc30b3c42dff","collectionKey":"f8fa60c6-4a51-49c1-9546-a3bb02ca3850","institution":"Virginia Museum of Natural History","collection":"Entomology","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Kal Ivanov","lat":36.686600,"lon":-79.863400,"institution_code":"VMNH","collection_code":"VMNH","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:50d316dd-90e0-46a0-a7ed-2c730f4f99aa","collection_url":"http://www.vmnh.net/","contact_email":"kal.ivanov@vmnh.virginia.gov","mailing_address":"21 Starling Avenue","mailing_city":"Martinsville","mailing_state":"Virginia","mailing_zip":"24112","physical_address":"21 Starling Avenue","physical_city":"Martinsville","physical_state":"Virginia","physical_zip":"24112","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:906d26a2-01e3-42a8-a099-614cb2e1ca83"},{"institutionKey":"78760aa3-3094-4e9d-ab0e-b4628bda5b6c","collectionKey":"333f4443-3807-4aa5-87bf-34f6648ba5d0","institution":"Mississippi Museum of Natural Science","collection":"Vertebrate Paleontology","description":"30,000 vertebrate fossils (2-28-2017) covering primarily the Upper Cretaceous marine, Paleogene marine, and Pleistocene terrestrial record of Mississippi and the surrounding Gulf Coastal Plain.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"George E.

A large part of the Illinois Natural History Fish Collection comes from specimens collected from 1880 to 1905 for S.A. Forbes and R.E. Richardson&#39;s &quot;The Fishes of Illinois&quot; published in 1908 and from specimens collected from 1950 to 1978 for P.W. Smith&#39;s &quot;The Fishes of Illinois&quot; published in 1979. Thousands of specimens have been added from other areas of North and South America in the past few decades. The collection contains representatives from 48 of the 50 states and many countries including: Angola, Antigua, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, England, Guyana, Indonesia, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Trinidad Venezuela, and Yugoslavia. The geographic scope of the collection is about 58% from Illinois, 28% from elsewhere in North America, 13% from South America, and 1% from the rest of the world, including Antarctica.  \t  \tHoldings. The collection contains nearly 865,000 catalogued specimens and over 100,000 lots, which makes it about the 15th largest collection of preserved fishes, and the 6th largest collection of Neotropical fishes in North America. Represented are about 170 families and over 2,500 species. The value of the collection is greatly enhanced by the large number of old specimens, many of which were collected in the late 1800&#39;s from areas where they no longer occur. The type collection contains 1220 specimens representing 93 nominal species. Name-bearing type material consists of 31 holotypes (37 species), 5 lectotypes, and 7 series of syntypes (39 specimens). Additional type material includes paratypes of 125 nominal species (1,198 specimens).  \t  \tWe also maintain a tissue collection that contains over 1000 high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Christopher A.

Founded in the early 1900s, this collection consists of approximately 89% North Carolina material, although 31 states, 21 countries, and more than 405 genera are represented. The Vertebrate Paleontology Collection contains eight holotypes and twelve paratypes. The type collections include several different fish and sharks and one bird specimen. The most published on specimens in this collection are an Acrocanthosaurus atokensis which has been used in numerous phylogenetic studies of therapods and a Thescelosaurus specimen. Significant holding include Late Triassic collections from North Carolina and Arizona, marine Cenozoic collections from North Carolina, and Cretaceous collections from North Carolina, Montana and Utah.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Sean Moran","lat":35.782200,"lon":-78.639600,"institution_code":"NCMNS, NCSM","collection_code":"NCSM-VertPaleo","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:0d5d7048-9563-4e04-8a45-9f0150df0970","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/pb54-382v","collection_url":"https://naturalsciences.org/research-collections/collections/vertebrate-paleontology-collection","collection_catalog_url":"https://collections.naturalsciences.org/search/paleontology","contact_role":"Collections Manager, Paleontology and Geology","contact_email":"sean.moran@naturalsciences.org","mailing_address":"11 West Jones Street","mailing_city":"Raleigh","mailing_state":"NC","mailing_zip":"27601","physical_address":"11 West Jones Street","physical_city":"Raleigh","physical_state":"NC","physical_zip":"27511","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:7941acfb-400a-48e9-b2b8-615850ef912f"},{"institutionKey":"110f5820-2b66-4308-bfaa-a6c412d29301","collectionKey":"eb754b0d-2c1c-455d-9fbf-fbced8dbfd61","institution":"New Mexico State University, Collection of Arthropods","collection":"Arthropods","recordsets":"ff111763-e72d-4f24-8914-b5b2dd94908c","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"ff111763-e72d-4f24-8914-b5b2dd94908c\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Scott Bundy","lat":32.775100,"lon":-108.283300,"institution_code":"NMSU","collection_code":"NMSU","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:935593cf-eb3d-4cf2-adc6-7828218f932d","collection_url":"http://arthropods.nmsu.edu/","contact_role":"Director","contact_email":"cbundy@nmsu.edu","mailing_address":"945 College Avenue, Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology, Weed Science","mailing_city":"Las Cruces","mailing_state":"New Mexico","mailing_zip":"88003","physical_address":"945 College Avenue, Department of Entomology, Plant Pathology, Weed Science","physical_city":"Las Cruces","physical_state":"New Mexico","physical_zip":"88003","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:5140fcc8-46aa-4505-b78c-006ed8998433"},{"institutionKey":"a4369eef-400b-4042-bad9-e3eafd230ed1","collectionKey":"90dd58c2-5db1-4899-82e0-ec8e330b78a1","institution":"Linfield College","collection":"Herbarium","recordsets":"23b85d9d-4669-40db-901f-aaad686fe0b8","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"23b85d9d-4669-40db-901f-aaad686fe0b8\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":4552,"contact":"John Syirng","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=177283","lat":45.201908,"lon":-123.199567,"institution_code":"LINF, LINCO","collection_code":"Vascular, LINCO","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:d96e6e19-935f-423f-a625-e30ca81e8424","geographic_range":"Pacific Northwest, with focus on the Willamette Valley, Cascade Mountains and Oregon coast; Malheur County and the Siskiyou Mts. of southwestern Oregon","contact_role":"Herbarium Director and Curator","contact_email":"jsyring@linfield.edu","mailing_address":"900 SE Baker St.","mailing_city":"McMinnville","mailing_state":"Oregon","mailing_zip":"97128","physical_address":"900 SE Baker St.","physical_city":"McMinnville","physical_state":"Oregon","physical_zip":"97128"},{"institutionKey":"d14b87c0-68c2-4843-8816-1daf516851bd","collectionKey":"5c1b637d-1197-4f58-b24d-f7281ce460df","institution":"Columbus State University","collection":"Herbarium","cataloguedSpecimens":10000,"contact":"Kevin S..

The MSB Division of Amphibians and Reptiles maintains nearly 100,000 specimens, mostly from the Southwestern United States (primarily from New Mexico and surrounding states). The collection also includes substantial numbers of specimens from elsewhere in the U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean region, the Galapagos Islands, and Vietnam. The division maintains representative skeletal material, a small type collection, and a collection of uncatalogued specimens for teaching purposes. Important collections in the division&rsquo;s holdings are from Big Bend National Park by W.G. Degenhardt and T.L. Brown (all taxa), the Appalachian Plateau by G.B. Wilmott (salamanders), the West Indies by K.L. Jones (leptodactylid frogs), and the Delmarva Peninsula by R. Conant (all taxa). A collection of 5,000 amphibians and reptiles made by William J. Koster formed the basis of the original collection; however,a dramatic increase in holdings occurred with the arrival of William G. Degenhardt in 1960 from Texas A&amp;M University. Through Degenhardt&rsquo;s own collecting efforts and those of his students, the division grew rapidly in size during the 1960&rsquo;s and 70&rsquo;s. Since the late 1980&rsquo;s, the division has become the primary repository for specimens collected as part of expanding research on the State&rsquo;s herpetofauna by the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, and continues to receive collections provided by researchers from a variety of state and federal agencies. These extensive collections and the increased knowledge of New Mexico&rsquo;s herpetofauna has resulted in the publication of Amphibians and Reptiles of New Mexico (1996) by W.G. Degenhardt, C.W. Painter &amp; A.H. Price.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"J Tomasz Giermakowski","institution_code":"MSB","collection_code":"Herp, Amphibian And Reptile Specimens","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:6d3ab4ec-02dd-4aa7-af42-d86a10ea46c8","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/appb-7y8a","collection_url":"http://www.msb.unm.edu/herpetology/index.html","contact_role":"Sr. Collection Manager","contact_email":"msbherp@unm.edu","mailing_address":"Museum of Southwestern Biology, CERIA Building, MSC03 2020, 1 University of New Mexico","mailing_city":"Albuquerque","mailing_state":"New Mexico","mailing_zip":"87131-0001","physical_address":"Museum of Southwestern Biology, CERIA Building, MSC03 2020, 1 University of New Mexico","physical_city":"Albuquerque","physical_state":"New Mexico","physical_zip":"87131-0001","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:83441270-bc50-4e1d-9eb9-42d4e3255bf4"},{"institutionKey":"65419b52-6e28-4c0c-8b86-1f9071440ecd","collectionKey":"a3c14f8d-9924-430c-99aa-047d2cd52d63","institution":"University of South Alabama","collection":"Herbarium","recordsets":"1f8c7572-5cda-44be-9a78-0658217fc279","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"1f8c7572-5cda-44be-9a78-0658217fc279\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":16700,"taxonCoverage":"Primarily vascular plants; Poaceae, especially <Panicum>","contact":"Kelly M.

Research topics include the species limits and species diversity, evolution, geography, genetics and genomics, morphology, conservation, ecology, and behavior. This work is greatly enhanced by extensive research collections of world birds, numbering more than 107,000 specimens, many of which are recently collected as part of the group's global bird sampling program.<br /> <br />\n\n\nOrnithology's study skin collections total about 60,000 specimens. The historical collections are strongest for the Great Plains of the United States and for Mexico, with additional holdings from Central and South America, Borneo, and Kenya. Recent large-scale collections have built significant recent holdings from Mexico, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Panama, Guyana, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mongolia, China, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Fiji, Palau, and others. Collections of special importance include series of more than 14,000 House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), which formed the basis for landmark scientific research by Richard Johnston and his students; extensive series of several North American species (Red-winged Blackbird Agelaius phoeniceus, meadowlarks Sturnella spp., Horned LarkEremophila alpestris); series documenting many of the Great Plains hybrid zones; and the feathers of an extinct moa (Dinornithidae). Recent additions include extensive series from Guyana, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Paraguay, including many species otherwise poorly represented in scientific collections.<br /> <br />\n\nThe avian osteological collections are extensive, totaling over 32,500 specimens, and ranked third largest in the world (Wood and Schnell 1986). This component of the collection has important strengths from the Great Plains of the United States, Mexico, and northern South America. Important holdings include critical and unique Ecuadorian series, extensive recent Australian material, and a large series of steamer-ducks (Tachyeres sp.). Recent collecting activities have built South American skeletal holdings into an important collection, with material from poorly represented sectors such as the Atlantic Forest, the Yucatan Peninsula, Guyana, and montane Central America.<br /> <br />\nÂ \nAlthough fluid-preserved specimens were not an early focus of Ornithology activities, the collections at KU were ranked seventh in North America at the time of the last summary of anatomical holdings (Wood et al. 1982). More recently, as part of Prum's research program, these collections have grown significantly, with important holdings of suboscine passeriform birds, among other groups. Now housed with ample space and ideal storage conditions in an NSF- and State of Kansas-funded addition, this collection is seeing increased research applications.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"","contact":"Mark Robbins","lat":38.957400,"lon":-95.245900,"institution_code":"KU, KANU","collection_code":"Birds, KU","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:09997b24-dca7-4bf3-afb9-4f025fe20935","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/v9yz-imvc","collection_url":"http://biodiversity.ku.edu/ornithology/collections","collection_catalog_url":"http://ornithology.biodiversity.ku.edu/collections-search","geographic_range":"","contact_role":"Collection Manager","contact_email":"mrobbins@ku.edu","mailing_address":"Biodiversity Institute, Dyche Hall, 1345 Jayhawk Boulevard","mailing_city":"Lawrence","mailing_state":"KS","mailing_zip":"66045","physical_address":"Biodiversity Institute, Dyche Hall, 1345 Jayhawk Boulevard","physical_city":"Lawrence, KS","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:356736e8-9e70-4516-bf04-1ad72ca6604f"},{"institutionKey":"75f50140-830d-4630-a290-3d6e951a7c29","collectionKey":"33c9878e-9a1b-4ca1-850e-21025fc3535e","institution":"Peabody Museum of Natural History","collection":"Paleobotany","recordsets":"7ae4d15d-62e2-459b-842a-446f921b9d3f","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":\"7ae4d15d-62e2-459b-842a-446f921b9d3f\"}","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Shusheng Hu","institution_code":"PMNH, YPM","collection_code":"YPM","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:d6702499-0698-4069-bf5f-9312bef7ed16","collection_url":"http://peabody.yale.edu/collections/paleobotany","collection_catalog_url":"http://peabody.yale.edu/collections/search-collections?pb","contact_role":"Collections Manager","contact_email":"shusheng.hu@yale.edu","mailing_address":"Yale University, PO Box 208118","mailing_city":"New Haven","mailing_state":"Connecticut","mailing_zip":"06511-0000","physical_address":"170-210 Whitney Avenue","physical_city":"New Haven","physical_state":"Connecticut","physical_zip":"06511-0000","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:8eb8c789-898c-4e9e-9c26-68768c612a6d"},{"institutionKey":"6fe7892d-1c1d-4528-8993-65c95bf975d4","collectionKey":"bd2ac4de-6d63-45e9-858c-d1912f1d8013","institution":"Bruce Museum of Arts and Science","collection":"Entomology/ Arachnology","description":"Dried specimens, pinned specimens","cataloguedSpecimens":1515,"contact":"Daniel Sepka","lat":41.019900,"lon":-73.625200,"institution_code":"null","collection_code":"null","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:7f3ce62b-c92a-4e94-95d3-144e87c03049","contact_email":"dksepka@brucemuseum.org","mailing_address":"1 Museum Drive","mailing_city":"Greenwich","mailing_state":"Connecticut","mailing_zip":"06830-0000","physical_address":"1 Museum Drive","physical_city":"Greenwich","physical_state":"Connecticut","physical_zip":"06830-0000"},{"institutionKey":"38ec0afd-1e72-4c44-9779-ca06fe4b35ae","collectionKey":"07c20cc5-8691-4917-ab88-bef407f94c75","institution":"Montshire Museum of Science","collection":"Ornithology","description":"Taxidermy, feathers","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Bob Raiselis","lat":43.700000,"lon":-72.307400,"institution_code":"MMS","collection_code":"MMS","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:7a881d8b-0338-4153-aff3-129ed6121be2","contact_email":"bob.raiselis@montshire.org","mailing_address":"1 Montshire Road","mailing_city":"Norwich","mailing_state":"Vermont","mailing_zip":"05055-0000","physical_address":"1 Montshire Road","physical_city":"Norwich","physical_state":"Vermont","physical_zip":"05055-0000"},{"institutionKey":"e1666b1f-f017-4a8f-8d98-a675360bed6e","collectionKey":"b535634a-14be-4b9a-8d75-66d7017709fd","institution":"USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS)","collection":"Insects","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Dawn E.

Currently located on the 2nd floor, A-wing, of the Baylor Sciences Building, the herbarium was organized by Dr. Floyd F. Davidson in 1967, then chair of the department, with the first curator Ms. Fannie Mae Hurst-Windham. Much of the herbarium is dedicated to Texas flora, though with specimens included from Oklahoma, Louisiana, Central/South America, and China. The herbarium also houses over 200+ specimens from Lindheimer, specifically those specimens near New Braunfels and Comanche Spring. Dr. Walter Holmes, Professor Emeritus of Biology at Baylor University, is the most recent curator of the herbarium who has specialized in the genus Mikania (Asteraceae) with the herbarium containing several types specimens.","cataloguedSpecimens":82000,"contact":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=124021","lat":31.532681,"lon":-97.129189,"institution_code":"BAYLU","collection_code":"BAYLU","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:a2542c23-94ac-4832-963d-b637d6b8365a","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:15737","collection_catalog_url":"https://portal.torcherbaria.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=463","geographic_range":"Texas.","mailing_address":"101 Bagby Avenue","mailing_city":"Waco","mailing_state":"Texas","mailing_zip":"76798-7388","physical_address":"101 Bagby Avenue","physical_city":"Waco","physical_state":"Texas"},{"institutionKey":"c8e1cb04-01ef-4804-a716-11ef204cf41b","collectionKey":"f723b21c-702a-4a31-9ea7-b94474a8c6f3","institution":"Texas Memorial Museum, Texas Natural History Collection","collection":"Invertebrate Zoology","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"James R.

Richardson and other Field Museum geologists plus numerous donations from other museums, universities, and the general public. In 1965 the Field Museum acquired the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Walker Museum fossil invertebrates, which more than doubled the total number of specimens in the collection. Today there are an estimated 2 million specimens divided into ~320,000 specimen lots. The majority of the collection is arranged systematically divided by geologic periods.

The MSB has over 96,000 cataloged lots of fishes (4,153,582 specimens), representing 63 families, 178 genera, and 420 species, collected between 1938 and present day. MSB fish records, available on FishNet2, include all holdings except for fishes collected on private and Tribal lands. MSB fish specimens consist of mostly cypriniform larval and adult fishes (vouchers and tissues), conserved, across taxa, in 5% buffered formalin, 70% and 95% ethanol, and frozen at -20&deg;C and -80&deg;C to maintain good examples for morphological, osteological, and genetic research. The MSB Division of Fishes does not hold holotypes and divides collections of paratypes with other permanent fish collections. Over 60,000 pages of field books and field data forms are archived in the Division. These documents are digitally captured and electronically archived in tiff files (permanent) and clean PDF files for viewing. The original field documents are maintained in acid and lignin free boxes for permanent storage.

The collection is used extensively by most of the world's arachnologists. The geographic scope is worldwide, with special strengths in the New World. The AMNH also has the second-largest collection of scorpions, and the largest collection of minor arachnid orders in North America. The myriapod collections are also among the largest in North America. The collections include a worldwide representation of arachnid and myriapod taxa, with a strong emphasis on material from North America and elsewhere in the New World. The majority of specimens are preserved in ethanol, although large collections of slide-mounted Acari and pseudoscorpions are also represented. A small quantity of unsorted dried material, mostly from South America, is being rehydrated and transferred to ethanol. Collections are continually being augmented with new material collected by AMNH staff, or acquired as donations or purchases.In 2002, the arachnid and myriapod collections were transferred to a new storage facility within the AMNH, the Starr Natural Sciences building (NSB). In the NSB, specimens are stored in state-of-the-art cabinetry and a climate-controlled environment to ensure their longevity. A complete overhaul of the collection, whereby all old, unstandardized bottles and vials, many with bake-lite closures or rubber stoppers, are replaced by new glass jars of standardized volumes with polyethylene closures and polypropylene-foam liners, has been underway for several years. The entire collection is also gradually being databased, and archival data labels newly printed for each specimen-lot.Scorpions comprise the second largest component of the AMNH arachnid and myriapod collections, after spiders. Currently comprising over 30,000 specimen-lots, including several hundred type specimens, the AMNH has the fourth-largest scorpion collection in the world, including a vast array of New and Old World taxa. Several thousand specimens from South America, Africa and Southeast Asia, including numerous undescribed species, remain to be sorted and identified, and the collection continues to be increased as a result of active field projects. Particular strengths of the collections are in New World, and especially North American families. The AMNH has one of the two largest collections of vaejovid scorpions in the world (the California Academy of Sciences has the other). It incorporates the Oscar F. Francke collection, rich in vaejovid and iurid material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A., and containing many large series collected with U.V. light detection, but also containing material from elsewhere in the world. It also incorporates the Willis J. Gertsch collection, containing a significant amount of material from Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A. Recent acquisition of the Alexis Harington collection (ca. 10,000 specimens) vastly expanded the holdings of African material. Southern African taxa are particularly well represented in this collection, which comprises a more representative sample than most southern African collections. All families and genera, and most species of southern African scorpions are represented; including many rare or seldom collected species. Most species are represented by series from multiple localities, many representing new records and/or range extensions. In addition, there are reasonable holdings of extralimital African taxa, and taxa from North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania. As part of Dr Prendini's research on the molecular systematics of scorpions, a synoptic collection of tissues from scorpions is steadily being deposited in the Ambrose Monell Collection for Molecular and Microbial Research of the AMNH. Developed through fieldwork and donations or exchanges with colleagues around the world, this collection is continually augmented and includes sizable holdings of tissue samples from Amblypygi, Schizomida, Solifugae and Thelyphonida and other arachnid and myriapod taxa, in addition to Scorpiones. Samples are housed at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-150Â°C) to maintain the highest quality and maximum stability of biomolecules indefinitely.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"World's largest collection of spiders and second largest collection of scorpions.","contact":"Lorenzo Prendini","lat":40.786000,"lon":-73.968400,"institution_code":"AMNH","collection_code":"AMNH","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:70aaed8a-0cb4-451e-a777-9e7b267485b7","collection_url":"https://www.amnh.org/our-research/invertebrate-zoology/collections/arachnida-araneae","geographic_range":"Global, with strengths in the New World, North America and Africa.","contact_role":"Curator-in-charge","contact_email":"lorenzo@amnh.org","mailing_address":"Central Park West at 79th St","mailing_city":"New York","mailing_state":"New York","mailing_zip":"10024-5192","physical_address":"Central Park West at 79th St","physical_city":"New York","physical_state":"New York","physical_zip":"10024-5192","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:a312a5eb-8a63-4ef7-b57c-6bbea34f37c3"},{"institutionKey":"abd0b819-538e-4398-96be-04345b280f6c","collectionKey":"adbfe3cc-0b56-4366-aac8-1fd16b635307","institution":"University of Utah","collection":"University of Utah Invertebrates Collection","description":"pinned and wet entomological specimens collected by students at the University of Utah","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"variety of recently collected Wasatch Front/Salt Lake County specimens","contact":"Donald H.

Significantly, it is the largest collection of polar dinosaurs in the world with 10,000 specimens, primarily from the North Slope of Alaska. It also comprises a diverse assortment of Alaskan Quaternary mammals, including a large portion of the material collected throughout Alaska by Otto W. Geist between the late 1920s and the 1960s. The collection also contains a variety of paleobotanical specimens and a large collection of invertebrates (both micro- and macrofossils). It is home to 39 holotypes and 409 paratypes, most of which are invertebrates. The collection is growing through active research projects in different regions of Alaska and collaboration with state and federal agencies.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Pat Druckenmiller","institution_code":"UAM","collection_code":"Earth Science, ES","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:28dd3d7c-d921-4c37-ad4b-093cf687f0a7","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/2q8w-b5qt","collection_url":"http://www.uaf.edu/museum/collections/earth/","collection_catalog_url":"http://arctos.database.museum/uam_es","contact_role":"Curator","contact_email":"psdruckenmiller@alaska.edu","mailing_address":"907 Yukon Drive  ","mailing_city":"Fairbanks","mailing_state":"AK","mailing_zip":"99775","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:447d59d3-b1e3-4419-a2a9-ea5b36b3f26e"},{"institutionKey":"4bd0a213-11df-4e7c-a40f-b4b090359c5a","collectionKey":"b2d21f08-7afe-4338-9ebf-19b549bf612e","institution":"Montana State University-Billings","collection":"Herbarium","description":"Montana State University-Billings Herbarium is a regional herbarium located in Eastern Montana.","cataloguedSpecimens":16000,"taxonCoverage":"Tropical flora of India;

Since most KNWR arthropod specimens are eventually to be deposited at the University of Alaska Museum, please refer to the UAM entomology collection loan policy for general loan guidelines.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Matt Bowser","institution_code":"KNWR Herb, KNWR","collection_code":"knwr_herb, KNWR:Herb","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:b45b427a-5f5e-4e47-8fee-c10259f28801","collection_url":"https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Kenai/what_we_do/science/specimens.html","collection_catalog_url":"http://arctos.database.museum/knwr_herb","contact_role":"user/administrator","contact_email":"matt_bowser@fws.gov","mailing_address":"Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, P.O.

Between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, the collections were formalized under the name Museum of Arid Land Biology (acronym MALB). In 1976, organizational changes instituted by the university resulted in the renaming of the collections and associated activities as the Laboratory for Environmental Biology (acronym UTEP, though locally called the &quot;LEB&quot;). In July of 1993, the Laboratory became associated with the University of Texas at El Paso&#39;s Centennial Museum through a memorandum of understanding. Curated specimens form the base for research by Centennial Museum personnel and faculty curators; by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso; and, through loans and visitation, graduate students and professionals from other institutions. The name was changed to UTEP Biodiversity Collections in August of 2012.  Collections primarily are of modern and fossil vertebrate biology (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and have a regional emphasis, but also contain material from outside the Southwest, particularly from Mexico. The research collections are maintained in the Biology Building.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Eli Greenbaum","lat":31.770000,"lon":-106.505400,"institution_code":"UTEP","collection_code":"Inv, Invertebrate specimens","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:d9f59cf7-04d0-44de-8a3f-616eec97f4c7","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/ep6d-knym","collection_catalog_url":"http://arctos.database.museum/home.cfm#UTEP","contact_role":"Director","contact_email":"egreenbaum2@utep.edu","mailing_address":"500 W.

The collection features extensive or complete collections of the spiders, butterflies, dragonflies, grasshoppers, and aculeate Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps) of the southern Colorado Plateau. In many cases the MNA holdings are the only complete collections of those taxa from the region. For example, the MNA collection contains 30 tiger beetle taxa from the southern Colorado Plateau, of which nearly one quarter are endemic (unique) to the region.  Also, of the nearly 150 butterfly taxa represented from the southern Plateau in the MNA collections, at least 7 (5%) are endemic.

The Division of Mammals contains over 250,000 catalogued specimens and is among the 5 largest in the world. Specimens date back to the 1890&#39;s with the majority documenting the rapid environmental change that has occurred since 1950. The collections are taxonomically broad, representing 27 orders, 103 families, 513 genera, ~1,400 species. The majority from the Orders Rodentia (190,000), Chiroptera (25,000), Carnivora (15,000), Soricomorpha (10,000) and Artiodactyla (7,500). The collections are world-wide in scope (72 countries and all 50 US states) with particularly strong holdings from Western North America (150,000 specimens), Beringia and high latitudes (26,000 from Alaska, Russia and Canada), Mongolia (4,200 specimens and parasites), and Latin America (10,200 specimens from Bolivia 7,000 from Chile; 5,000 from Panama). The collection contains 16 holotypes, 6 paratypes, 1 syntype, 93 symbiotypes. Important collections integrated into the MSB include the USGS Biological Surveys collection (26,000), the UIMNH (Hoffmeister) Collection (33,000), Rausch Collection (4,000 specimens and parasites). Specimens range from traditional skin/skull and fluid vouchers to &quot;holistic vouchers&quot; containing skin, skull, post-cranial skeleton, up to seven tissue types (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, muscle, blood), cell suspensions, and ecto and endo parasites. Additionally, frozen tissue samples are available for about 130,000 individual mammals and date back to the late 1970&#39;s. 37,000 specimens have serology data associated with hantavirus surveillance programs in the Americas.

Approximately 225,000 specimens are permanently mounted on microscope slides; the remaining specimens are stored in alcohol in vials and jars. With the exception of one monospecific order - Acanthobdellida (the bristle worms, restricted in distribution to the boreal regions in the Arctic) - the collection includes representatives of the other groups of worms in the phylum Annelida: Branchiobdellida (one family, Branchiobdellidae - the crayfish worms, including representatives of the subfamilies Bdellodrilinae, Cambarincolinae, and Xironodrilinae); Hirudinida (the leeches, including representatives in five families â Haemopidae, Hirudinidae, Erpobdellidae, Glossiphoniidae, and Piscicolidae); the Oligochaetous Clitellata {'Oligochaeta'}, with representatives of the aquatic microdrile worms (families Enchytraeidae, Haplotaxidae, Lumbriculidae, Naididae {now including the subfamilies in the former family Tubificidae}, and Opistocystidae), and the terrestrial megadrile oligochaetes â earthworms (families Acanthodrilidae, Glossoscolecidae, Komarekionidae, Lumbricidae, Megascolecidae, and Sparganophilidae); and Polychaeta (sand worms, tube worms, or clam worms â primarily marine) including a few representatives of the families Capitellidae and Sabellidae, and Aeolosomatida (one family, Aeolosomatidae â the head-crawling, or suction-feeding worms). Acquisition Highlights. An important acquisition for the INHS Annelida Collection in 1986 was the Walter J. Harman collection of terrestrial oligochaetes. The material in this collection, comprising 1,600 earthworm specimens representing 22 species, 10 genera, and 3 families, was collected by Dr. Harman from 230 sites in central Illinois during his 1956-1958 survey for his doctoral work at the University of Illinois. The information in Harman's thesis, previously unpublished records in Harman's original field notes, and records of other terrestrial oligochaetes collected over the years in Illinois and deposited in the INHS Annelida Collection were recently presented in a publication by Reynolds and Wetzel (2011): Megadrilogica 18 (4): 35-67. The INHS Annelida Collection contains primary types of six leech and one aquatic oligochaete species. The geographic scope of the INHS Annelida Collection is as follows: 76% from Illinois, 23% from elsewhere in North America (collections from the states of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida (including the Conch Republic), Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. John Island), and from the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nunavut, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island), and 1% from other countries, including Australia, the Bahamas, Colombia, Ecuador, Germany, Greenland, India, Jamaica, Lesser Antilles (Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica, Granada, Nexis, St. Lucia), The Netherlands, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Sweden, and Venezuela.","cataloguedSpecimens":350000,"taxonCoverage":"The INHS Annelida Collection is perhaps the largest state collection of freshwater oligochaetes in the country, holding 350,000 specimens (over 7,000 lots, or collections). Approximately 225,000 specimens are permanently mounted on microscope slides; the remaining specimens are stored in alcohol in vials and jars. With the exception of one monospecific order - Acanthobdellida (the bristle worms, restricted in distribution to the boreal regions in the Arctic) - the collection includes representatives of the other groups of worms in the phylum Annelida: Branchiobdellida (one family, Branchiobdellidae - the crayfish worms, including representatives of the subfamilies Bdellodrilinae, Cambarincolinae, and Xironodrilinae); Hirudinida (the leeches, including representatives in five families â Haemopidae, Hirudinidae, Erpobdellidae, Glossiphoniidae, and Piscicolidae); the Oligochaetous Clitellata {'Oligochaeta'}, with representatives of the aquatic microdrile worms (families Enchytraeidae, Haplotaxidae, Lumbriculidae, Naididae {now including the subfamilies in the former family Tubificidae}, and Opistocystidae), and the terrestrial megadrile oligochaetes â earthworms (families Acanthodrilidae, Glossoscolecidae, Komarekionidae, Lumbricidae, Megascolecidae, and Sparganophilidae); and Polychaeta (sand worms, tube worms, or clam worms â primarily marine) including a few representatives of the families Capitellidae and Sabellidae, and Aeolosomatida (one family, Aeolosomatidae â the head-crawling, or suction-feeding worms). Acquisition Highlights. An important acquisition for the INHS Annelida Collection in 1986 was the Walter J. Harman collection of terrestrial oligochaetes. The material in this collection, comprising 1,600 earthworm specimens representing 22 species, 10 genera, and 3 families, was collected by Dr. Harman from 230 sites in central Illinois during his 1956-1958 survey for his doctoral work at the University of Illinois.

The first catalogue ledger of the Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection was started in 1941.  The first 879 entries were transcribed from index cards and include specimens collected as far back as 1870.  Most of these early specimens do not include collector information.  The earliest specimen with collector information is an Eastern Massasauga collected by Stephen A. Forbes in Pekin, Illinois in 1873.  Also among these earliest records with collector data are specimens from Colorado collected by George Cooper and C.C. Crandall in 1875.  Other early collectors include F.S. Earle (specimens collected in Union Co., IL; 1877); Harrison Garman (Marshall Co., IL; 1878); H.A. Surface (Mason Co., IL; 1882) and Julius Hurter (Madison Co., IL; 1896).    Holdings. The Illinois Natural History Survey Amphibian and Reptile Collection contains approximately 24,000 catalogued specimens, representing 55 families and over 550 species (51% Amphibia, 49% Reptilia). The geographical emphasis is Illinois (75%). This is the result of the efforts of Phil W. Smith, who collected specimens from 1935 to 1949 for his comprehensive study &quot;The Amphibians and Reptiles of Illinois,&quot; published in 1961. In addition to the Illinois material, the INHS collection also houses specimens from 45 other U.S. states, Canada, the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Most notable among these are specimens collected by P.W. Smith from California (1943-1952) and Mexico (1957-1965), specimens of S.A. Minton from Pakistan, Mexico and Texas and specimens from Thailand collected by R.W. Larimore (1963).    Frozen Tissues. We also maintain a tissue collection that contains high quality tissues from a portion of our vouchered specimens, mostly those collected after 1998. This collection may be searched by choosing the appropriate link from the Data tab, above. The search engine will deliver limited location information.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Chris A.

Between the mid-1960s and the early 1970s, the collections were formalized under the name Museum of Arid Land Biology (acronym MALB). In 1976, organizational changes instituted by the university resulted in the renaming of the collections and associated activities as the Laboratory for Environmental Biology (acronym UTEP, though locally called the &quot;LEB&quot;). In July of 1993, the Laboratory became associated with the University of Texas at El Paso&#39;s Centennial Museum through a memorandum of understanding.  Curated specimens form the base for research by Centennial Museum personnel and faculty curators; by graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Texas at El Paso; and, through loans and visitation, graduate students and professionals from other institutions. The name was changed to UTEP Biodiversity Collections in August of 2012.  Collections primarily are of modern and fossil vertebrate biology (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and have a regional emphasis, but also contain material from outside the Southwest, particularly from Mexico. The research collections are maintained in the Biology Building.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Eli Greenbaum","lat":31.770000,"lon":-106.505400,"institution_code":"UTEP","collection_code":"Zoo, Zooplankton Specimens","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:723c4d7c-e736-4de8-9ee7-7dca44b0c9c2","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/6pz7-hkm6","collection_url":"http://www.utep.edu/biodiversity/collections/invertebrate-biology.html","collection_catalog_url":"http://arcto.database.museum/utep_zoo","contact_role":"Director","contact_email":"egreenbaum2@utep.edu","mailing_address":"500 W.

This diversity is most notable among the freshwater and terrestrial Mollusca. Approximately 200 of the 300 known species of North American freshwater mussels have been reported from the waters of Alabama, and these systems once supported nearly 250 species of aquatic snails. Additionally, there are 85 species of crayfish in Alabama, the highest of any state in the US. Unfortunately, this spectacular biodiversity has been severely compromised by human activities. Modification of large river systems has resulted in substantial habitat loss, and many aquatic species now have highly fragmented distributions.In 1999 we began to accumulate material from Alabamaâs populations of mollusks and other aquatic invertebrates.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Jack W.

With early acquisitions from the Brimley brothers in the late 1800&rsquo;s, the collection consists of 42% North Carolina, 81% Southeastern United States, 96% United States material, with the remainder having North American or other international origin. It encompasses the taxonomic units of 20 orders, 73 families, 237 genera, and over 500 unique Genus-species combinations. Holdings are especially strong in Rodentia, Soricimorpha, Chiroptera, Carnivora, Cetacea and Sirenia. Important recent acquisitions include University of Kentucky, George Mason University, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and personal collections. The collection includes study skins, tanned hides, skulls, complete skeletons, fluid-preserved material, tissues for molecular analyses, and other materials.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"taxonCoverage":"Mammalia","contact":"Lisa Gatens","lat":35.782200,"lon":-78.639600,"institution_code":"NCMNS, NCSM","collection_code":"NCSM-Mammals","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:e8756989-a13e-4e78-94f8-777ac3313c31","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/qdh3-6gcz","collection_url":"https://naturalsciences.org/research-collections/collections/mammalogy-collection","collection_catalog_url":"https://collections.naturalsciences.org/search/mammalogy","contact_role":"Collections Manager, Mammalogy","contact_email":"lisa.gatens@naturalsciences.org","mailing_address":"11 West Jones Street","mailing_city":"Raleigh","mailing_state":"NC","mailing_zip":"27601","physical_address":"1213 Fairlane Road","physical_city":"Cary","physical_state":"NC","physical_zip":"27511","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:7941acfb-400a-48e9-b2b8-615850ef912f"},{"institutionKey":"bb7a8cb9-c960-4239-a1d0-87a245d43d7f","collectionKey":"20e1c59e-0476-4b86-952b-ab4a2df4b429","institution":"University of North Carolina at Asheville","collection":"Herbarium","recordsets":"312cf3f1-2913-4c63-9ba8-0b870cd3c120, de67ccab-7d04-43b9-8083-81e45f628505","recordsetQuery":"{\"recordset\":[\"de67ccab-7d04-43b9-8083-81e45f628505\",\"312cf3f1-2913-4c63-9ba8-0b870cd3c120\"]}","cataloguedSpecimens":5000,"contact":"H.

Many of these regional specimens are not well represented in other academic or national museum collections. Flora and fauna from the Carboniferous, Permian, and Cretaceous Periods are particularly well represented. The collection also includes more than 50 type specimens of Pennsylvanian and Early Cretaceous mollusks, and Pennsylvanian insects.

The collection consists primarily of insects, arachnids, and crustaceans. The pinned collection contains over 3,200 genera and 7,500 identified species. These counts are underestimated because they were made over a decade ago and the majority of the collection holdings have not been identified nor cataloged. The estimated minimal numbers are: Pinned Insects about 1 million individuals, Med/Vet Zoology about 75,000, Arachnids under 50,000, Miscellaneous groups under 1,000. At least 3 million specimens are retained as sealed, bulk specimens. These samples are mostly cataloged and are being split and labeled as time permits (motivated by researchers' needs). There are currently slightly more than 800 type specimens (mostly paratypes) in the collection.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Jennifer GirÃ³n","lat":33.590161,"lon":-101.885810,"institution_code":"TTU","collection_code":"TTU-Z","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:9d441784-1ecc-4cab-b959-8fe043f42cf5","collection_url":"https://www.depts.ttu.edu/nsrl/collections/Invertebrate_Zoology/index.php","collection_catalog_url":"https://scan-bugs.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=7","contact_role":"Acting Collections Manager","contact_email":"jennifer.giron@ttu.edu","mailing_address":"3301 4th St, PO Box 43191","mailing_city":"Lubbock","mailing_state":"Texas","mailing_zip":"79409","physical_address":"3301 4th St, PO Box 43191","physical_city":"Lubbock","physical_state":"Texas","physical_zip":"79409","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:acf2c3d2-5011-4bc6-ad0e-8fee7547a0f4"},{"institutionKey":"91eecf8e-02d4-4bdd-b57d-da801bb357f6","collectionKey":"be78d9ca-1e40-4143-9a18-96f4852dac0d","institution":"University of Tulsa","collection":"Herbarium","cataloguedSpecimens":11500,"contact":"","sameAs":"http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=126875","lat":36.146870,"lon":-95.945366,"institution_code":"TULS","collection_code":"TULS","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:07ed6190-a075-4059-9d52-a28d056f972a","collection_lsid":"urn:lsid:biocol.org:col:14653","geographic_range":"Oklahoma.","mailing_city":"Tulsa","mailing_state":"Oklahoma","mailing_zip":"74104-3189","physical_address":"600 South College Avenue.","physical_city":"Tulsa","physical_state":"Oklahoma"},{"institutionKey":"8759e747-e33f-46c5-b1d3-4f008295dddc","collectionKey":"306a7562-843e-4678-8757-394aa783f356","institution":"Chicago Academy of Sciences","collection":"Earth Sciences, Paleontology","cataloguedSpecimens":23200,"taxonCoverage":"Invertebrates and plants.","contact":"Dawn Roberts","lat":41.926835,"lon":-87.635343,"institution_code":"CASM, CHAS, CA","collection_code":"CHAS","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:49e72e88-f27e-4511-a7ec-71cdec3d8acc","collection_url":"http://www.naturemuseum.org/the-museum/collections/Earth-Science","geographic_range":"North America, particularly the Midwest / Great Lakes region of the United States.","contact_role":"Director of Collections","contact_email":"droberts@naturemuseum.org","mailing_address":"2430 North Cannon Drive","mailing_city":"Chicago","mailing_state":"Illinois","mailing_zip":"60614","physical_address":"2430 North Cannon Drive","physical_city":"Chicago","physical_state":"Illinois","physical_zip":"60614","UniqueNameUUID":"urn:uuid:93877ee6-76bc-4ca0-8ee6-7eae72061ed6"},{"institutionKey":"44830617-a6c6-40d6-837e-b89e344ea4e4","collectionKey":"33bd3d04-6bd8-401c-92cf-0ca6712707b8","institution":"Haleakala National Park","collection":"Herbarium","cataloguedSpecimens":2537,"contact":"Elizabeth A.

With specimens from locations worldwide, the collections are second to none in coverage for the Nearctic and Neotropical regions. Specimens from the Old World are also well represented, especially from Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. Particular strengths include mosquitoes, wasps, beetles, butterflies and moths, and flies. Although the bulk of the collection is kept dry, various groups&mdash;such as spiders&mdash;are stored in alcohol.   The collections are typically arranged by taxon; lower categories (genus, species) are arranged alphabetically, and for select taxa, they are further organized by country of origin within each species.   While the majority of the collection is housed at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, some groups are held at other research facilities in nearby Maryland, including the USDA Agricutural Research Center&#39;s Systematic Entomology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland and the Smithsonian Institution&#39;s Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland.","cataloguedSpecimens":0,"contact":"Jessica Bird","institution_code":"USNM, NMNH, US","collection_code":"Entomology, ENT","collection_uuid":"urn:uuid:18e3cd08-a962-4f0a-b72c-9a0b3600c5ad","collection_lsid":"http://grbio.org/cool/1wcv-afpg","collection_url":"https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/entomology","collection_catalog_url":"http://collections.nmnh.si.edu/search/ento/","contact_role":"Collections Information Manager","contact_email":"NMNH-ENTO-CIMU@si.edu","mailing_address":"P.O.

The major collections include plants of Trans-Pecos Texas, which forms the largest part of the northern part of the Chihuahuan Desert Region in the United States. It is a prominent regional research collection that is available to botanists around the world and is also a valuable teaching facility for both graduate and undergraduate students interested in various botanical disciplines or in wildlife biology. The first significant collections are those made by O.E. Sperry in 1935-1946. The physical herbarium was probably started by L.C. Hinkley but B.H. Warnock was responsible for the largest early collection of plants and major development of the herbarium as a research facility. Another major contributor was M.C Johnston. More recently, the herbarium has grown through the efforts of A.M. Powell, in whose honor the university renamed the herbarium in 2003.","cataloguedSpecimens":100000,"contact":"A.
